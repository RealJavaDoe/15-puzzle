### About the game
Also called *le taquin* in French, *el juego del 15* or *taken* in Spanish, *il gioco del quindici* in Italian, *das 15-Puzzle* or *FÃ¼nfzehnerspiel* in German, the 15-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.

### About the code
This is a java implementation of the 15-puzzle. The code was written specifically for Windows.

This is a more completed version than [the one written before](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/some_code/blob/master/classes/MyPuzzle.java). And if the code fits in one class ([FifteenPuzzle.java](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/15-puzzle/blob/master/FifteenPuzzle.java)), the game has several options:

| Key | Intended effect |
| :---: | --- |
| ![alt text](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/15-puzzle/blob/master/images/buttons/random.png) | Display five random pictures as thumbnails and then choose the one you want to play with |
| ![alt text](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/15-puzzle/blob/master/images/buttons/list.png) | Select five pictures by yourself thanks to their numbers - as thumbnails - and then choose the one you want to play with |
| ![alt text](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/15-puzzle/blob/master/images/buttons/color.png) | Switch between black and white and color pictures: 170 pictures each (black and white pictures are the ones displayed by default) |
| | Save your score as soon as the game is over |
| **31** | View the top ten scores of each selected picture |
| ![alt text](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/15-puzzle/blob/master/images/buttons/gridPattern.png)| Grid the reference picture |
| ![alt text](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/15-puzzle/blob/master/images/buttons/soundOn.png) | Turn the sound on/off whenever you want (that is enabled by default) |
| ![alt text](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/15-puzzle/blob/master/images/buttons/scramble.png) | Scramble anytime |
| **EN** | Select your language preference: English (**EN**), French (**FR**), Spanish (**ES**), Italian (**IT**) or German (**DE**) for now (English is the default language) |
| ![alt text](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/15-puzzle/blob/master/images/buttons/numberDisplay.png) | Show or hide each tile number (all numbers are hidden by default) |
